# üíª Laptop Auto Power-On After Power Loss
**PlatformIO Project for ATtiny13A (Arduino Framework)**

Automatically turn on your **laptop** or other **DC-powered computer** after power loss using an ATtiny13A microcontroller.

This is especially useful for systems that **don‚Äôt support the ‚ÄúPower On After Power Loss‚Äù** option in BIOS.

---

## üß† Overview

The microcontroller monitors the system power via `POWER_STATUS_PIN` and presses the `POWER_SWITCH_PIN` automatically when power is off. Once the system powers on, the controller stops activity until the next full power cycle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behavior Logic

1. When power is supplied, the ATtiny13A starts up.
2. It waits **1 second** for voltage stabilization.
3. If the system power (detected via `POWER_STATUS_PIN`) is **off**:
   - Press the **power switch** (`POWER_SWITCH_PIN`) every 1 second.
   - After each press, check the system state again.
4. Once power is detected (`POWER_STATUS_PIN` HIGH):
   - The microcontroller **locks up** (`while(1)`) and stops any further activity until the next full power cycle.

## üßë‚Äçüîß Assembly & Upload

1. **Upload the firmware** using PlatformIO:

    pio run --target upload

2. **Assemble the hardware** following the schematic below:
